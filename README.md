## Overview

**GitHub Actions** gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. You can write individual tasks ("Actions") and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are configurable automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub.

With **GitHub Actions** you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository.
